## Install

- **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install the dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ yarn
```

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

If you don't need autofocus when your files was changed, then run `dev` with env `START_MINIMIZED=true`:

```bash
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to the [Multi Platform Build docs](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,

```bash
$ yarn package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ yarn package --[option]
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ yarn build-e2e
$ yarn test-e2e

# Running e2e tests in a minimized window
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn build-e2e
$ yarn test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:

```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package
```

## CSS Modules

This boilerplate is configured to use [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) out of the box.

All `.css` file extensions will use css-modules unless it has `.global.css`.

If you need global styles, stylesheets with `.global.css` will not go through the
css-modules loader. e.g. `app.global.css`

If you want to import global css libraries (like `bootstrap`), you can just write the following code in `.global.css`:

```css
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

## SASS support

If you want to use Sass in your app, you only need to import `.sass` files instead of `.css` once:

```js
import './app.global.scss';
```

## Static Type Checking

This project comes with Flow support out of the box! You can annotate your code with types, [get Flow errors as ESLint errors](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors), and get [type errors during runtime](https://github.com/codemix/flow-runtime) during development. Types are completely optional.

## Dispatching redux actions from main process

See [#118](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/118) and [#108](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/108)

## How to keep your project updated with the boilerplate

If your application is a fork from this repo, you can add this repo to another git remote:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate.git
```

Then, use git to merge some latest commits:

```sh
git pull upstream master
```
